            <h3>GOALS</h3>
            <p>The process starts with clearly defined objectives. How will you know how to change if you don’t know what needs changing. We’ll develop your goals in conversation together.</p>
            <h3>GROWTH</h3>
            <p>The growth stage is the meat in the sandwich. It is here that you put new strategies to work, and begin addressing the issues that have been holding you back.</p>
            <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
            <p>At this point in the process I ask you to reflect on the changes you’ve made, and whether you’re satisfied with there the results have led you. After this, we can address sustainability.</p>
